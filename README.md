This system is the various work that I have done in order to learn the Swing library better. It includes
  the ability to resize the window, either by using KeyPress events, or the button associated. The resize
  window includes the ability to input the exact height and width, in pixels, and then change the main
  window to become that size. The system also has a small self-destruct system that allows for the three
  buttons to interact with each other, as well as a countdown pop-up. Lastly there is the bare bones
  for a data management system, which has yet to be implemented.
